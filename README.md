## FAQ
<details>
<summary>Q: Why are things named without a dot at the beginning?</summary>
A: It makes it easier to include files in this repo if they are not named
exactly how they would be when symlinked over (I symlink the files here to my home
directory).  e.g. if I want to include the global `.gitignore` in this repo it
will override this repo's `.gitignore`.
